google login now working  
:smile:

8th April : After over 2 weeks of trying to figure out if facebook login will work with instagram I have finally discovered when they(facebook) removed instagram authentication they did not provide an alternative.
Thus things to note in certain user cases 
user has facebook = :unlock:
user has email = :unlock:
user has only instagram? = create account with either facebook or email and then :unlock:

facebook login now working  
:smile:

instagram token accessed   
:smile:


explanation the flow to get insta info
get permissions but first using at pop up window 
this gives user token 
this user token can be exchanged to loglived one 
and this can be used to make calls to the instagram graph api
explanation the flow to get FB info
get permissions but first using at pop up window 
this gives user token 
this user token can be exchanged to loglived one 
and this can be used to make calls to the facebook graph api
TODO : 
explain the flow to get youtube info

11th updated keywords query and mutation and allowed keywords to be created from users
12th updated models to reflect original project.
user.js portal why ? especially since we have portaljs and portal types ? q for alvinio
Added various types for facebook instagram and youtube (remember to change google in app.js to store to the youtube object)
